# Sass Project

This project uses **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)**, a CSS extension language that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to make styling more efficient and maintainable. Sass helps create modular, reusable styles for cleaner and more structured CSS.

The code in this project demonstrates key Sass features for managing and organizing stylesheets effectively.
